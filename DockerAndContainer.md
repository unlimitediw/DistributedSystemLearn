## Containers
### What is container?
* Runtime OS (e.g linux): inside are processes. The container is used to isolate one process to other processes (sandbox)
  * The container process is tied in with the lifecycle of container.
* Container Image
  * Contains binary state: such as VMDK(Virtual Machine Disk) is a disk image OVA(Open Virtual Appliance) is a image for VM.
  * Tree effectively, concentrate specific things in specific places
* Dockerfile
  * Syntax(e.g)
    * From: busybox (within here we can run any number of things that we want to configure the image that the docker file is going to create.
* Runtime OS and Dockerfile can both communicate with Image.
* Docker Host(Tie OS, Image and Dockfile together)
  * Registry outside(pull and push the image you need)
  * Image cache inside (satisfy pulling and pushing of registry)
  * Client outside (Control pull, push, create, run and commit image) 
    * Client can also do network and storage configuration
    * Client manage container lifecycle
  * Deamon inside (Client talk to deamon with API) 
  * Storage inside(but beyond lifecyle) (Volume, a persistent area of storage) or network (push it out on network)
    * Use it if it wants to persist any data beyond the lifecycle of the container
    * Network will also allow persistence after container end
  * Life Cycle 
### Containers and VMs
* VM
	* APP -> OS -> VM -> Hypervisor -> Physical (notice that Application virtualization and Hosted virtualization are onside of OS)
  * VM: NIC(Network interface), Storage and Size
	* Hypervisor: NIC, Storage, Agents and Kernel
* Container
  * App + OS Dependences = Container -> OS -> VM -> Hypervisor -> Physical (VM may be combined using with Container
### Docker Introduction
* Task 0: Prerequisites
  * It need a linux environment and a DockerID
* Task 1: Run some simple Docker containers
  * Three different ways to use containers:
    1. To run a single task: This could be a shell script or a custom app.
    2. Interactively: This connects you to the container similar to the way 
    3. In the background: For long-running services like websites and databases
  * Run a single task in an Alpine Linux container
    1. Run "docker container run alpine hostname". The container will start, execute hostname command then exit
      * Pull "alpine:latest" image from Docker Hub
      * The container's hostname will be displayed
    2. Check container states after hostname processing exits(container stop) by running "docker container ls --all"
      * Docker doesn't delete resources by default and the container still exist in the "Exited" state
  * Run an interactive Ubuntu container
		1. Run a Docker container and access its shell by "docker container run --interactive --tty --rm ubuntu bash"
			* "--interactive" says you want an interactive session
			* "--tty" allocates a pseudo-tty
			* "--rm" tells Docker to go ahead and remove the container when it's done exuecuting
			* bash(which is a shell, a user interface for access to an operating system) is used as main process
			* When the container starts youâ€™ll drop into the bash shell with the default prompt root@<container id>:/#. Docker has attached to the shell in the container, relaying input and output between your local session and the shell session in the container.
			* Now you are in the bash shell
		2. Run "ls /", "ps aux" and "cat/etc/issue"
			* "ls /" list the contents of the root director in the container
			* "ps aux" show running processes in the container
				* USER PID ... STAT START TIME COMMAND
				* root 1 ... SS 00:12 0:00 bash
				* root 14 ...R+ 00:22 0:00 ps aux
		3. Type "exit" to leave the shell session. This will terminate the bash process, causing the container to exit
			* Run a background MySQL container
					1. Run a new MySQL container with
						 docker container run \
						 --detach \
						 --name mydb \
						 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw \
						 mysql:latest
						* "--detach" will run the container in the background
						* "--name" will name it mydb
						* -e will use an environment variable to specify the root password
					2. List the running containers "docker container ls"
					3.
